# Beyond-the-Bus-Stop-Brisbane-Public-Transport-Flow
This project analyzes 17M+ Brisbane public transport trip records (3.6GB dataset) enriched with weather (BoM) and demographics (ABS Census) data to uncover commuter behavior, suburb connectivity, and demand patterns.

Key Features

Big Data ETL: Processed multi-source datasets with Polars for high-performance data wrangling.

Demand Forecasting: Built and tuned LightGBM/XGBoost models to predict monthly bus ridership with strong accuracy.

Interactive Dashboards: Developed Tableau and Streamlit + Folium apps to visualize commuter flows, suburb-level demand, and operator dominance.

Insights for Policy: Identified issues in route/operator dominance and suburb connectivity; provided data-driven recommendations for transport authorities.

What I Learned

Handling large-scale transport datasets efficiently (3.6GB+, 17M rows).

Advanced feature engineering with temporal and weather variables.

Building interactive, stakeholder-friendly dashboards for policy decision support.

Collaborating in a 6-person team using design thinking and Agile approaches.

Tech Stack: Python (Polars, LightGBM, Geopy), Streamlit, Folium, Tableau
