# Beyond the Bus Stop — Brisbane Public Transport Flow

**DATA7001 Project | Machine Learning & Data Visualization**

This project analyzes over **17 million Brisbane public transport trip records** (≈3.6GB), enriched with **weather (BoM)** and **demographic (ABS Census)** data, to uncover commuter behavior, suburb connectivity, and demand patterns.

## Key Features
- **Big Data ETL:** Processed and cleaned multi-source datasets using Polars for efficient computation.  
- **Demand Forecasting:** Built and tuned LightGBM/XGBoost models to predict monthly bus ridership with strong accuracy.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Created Tableau and Streamlit visualizations to explore commuter flows and demand patterns.  
- **Policy Insights:** Identified issues in operator dominance and suburb connectivity; proposed data-driven improvements.

## What I Learned
- Managing and analyzing large datasets (17M+ rows, 3.6GB).  
- Advanced feature engineering with temporal and weather-based predictors.  
- Creating interactive dashboards for technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Working in an Agile, team-based environment with design thinking approaches.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Polars, LightGBM, XGBoost, Geopy  
- **Visualization:** Streamlit, Folium, Tableau  
- **Workflow:** Agile framework, Jira, design thinking

## Outcomes
- Forecast models provided accurate monthly bus demand predictions.  
- Dashboards visualized suburb-to-suburb flows, highlighting network bottlenecks.  
- Insights supported recommendations for improving connectivity and reducing reliance on dominant operators.
